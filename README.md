## Overview

Project Name: Text Translation with mBART and Generation using BLOOM
Associated with : Course BSCS-604 Natural Language Processing

## Model Details

### mBART 50
- mBART 50 is a multilingual machine translation model that also uses the transformer architecture. 
- It is trained on a dataset of parallel text in many languages, and is able to translate text between different languages.
- For this project I used the mBART-50 many to one multilingual machine translation fine-tuned check point of the mBART Large 50 pre-trained model by Facebook.

### BLOOM
- BLOOM is a large language model that uses the transformer architecture to process and generate text.
- It is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and is capable of generating human-quality text in many languages.
- I have opted for the 7B parameter version for this project
